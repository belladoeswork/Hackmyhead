            <span class="halloween">halloween</span> is a holiday celebrated on October 31, and its history can be traced back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. Samhain marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. It was believed that on this night, the boundary between the living and the dead was blurred, and ghosts and spirits roamed the earth. <span class="txt_icon"> üëª </span>

             Over time, the Celtic festival evolved, and as Christianity spread, November 1st became All Saints' Day, a day to honor saints and martyrs. The evening before, October 31st, became known as All Hallows' Eve, which eventually became <span class="halloween">halloween</span>. <span class="txt_icon"> üéÉ </span>
